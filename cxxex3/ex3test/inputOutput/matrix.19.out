2. 	trace
3. 	det
4. 	transpose

Operation += requires 2 operand matrices.
How would you like the first matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
How would you like the second matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
Insert first matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
Insert second matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.

Got first matrix:
0.000	0.000	4.340	-4.000	
56345.135	-30.000	0.000	-11.100	
-1.001	-53.233	2.000	0.000
Number of elements actually in List:8

Got second matrix:
-23.000	34.000	56.000	23.001	
23.450	0.000	0.000	130.000	
0.100	3.000	4.000	0.000
Now the first matrix is:
