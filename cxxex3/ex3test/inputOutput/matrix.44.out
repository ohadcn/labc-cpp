Choose operation:
1. 	-
2. 	trace
3. 	det
4. 	transpose
5. 	+
6. 	*
7. 	+=
8. 	*=
9. 	==
10. 	!=
Operation != requires 2 operand matrices.
How would you like the first matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
How would you like the second matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
Insert first matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
Insert second matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.

Got first matrix:
10.000	2.346	-2.222	0.100	
0.000	0.000	3.000	0.400	
0.210	1.000	3.010	-0.500
Number of elements actually in List:10

Got second matrix:
10.000	2.345	-2.223	0.100	
0.000	0.000	3.000	0.400	
0.100	1.000	3.010	-0.500
Number of elements actually in List:10
==========
The two matrices are different.
