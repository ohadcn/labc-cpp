How would you like the first matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
How would you like the second matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
Insert first matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
Insert second matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
--------
Got first matrix:
1.200	3.400	-5.600	0.100	
-10.100	10.000	100.000	1000.000
--------
Got second matrix:
10.000	20.200	
-1.000	0.000	
0.000	2.000	
3.000	4.000
Now the first matrix is:
==========
Resulted matrix:
8.900	13.440	
2889.000	3995.980
