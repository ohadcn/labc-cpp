How would you like the first matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
How would you like the second matrix to be represented (1 for regular and 2 for sparse)?
Insert first matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
Insert second matrix:
number of rows:number of columns:Now insert the values of the matrix, row by row.
After each cell add the char ',' (including after the last cell of a row).
Each row should be in a separate line.
